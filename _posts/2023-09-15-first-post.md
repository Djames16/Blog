# Into the mind of a first Full Stack Development Student 

The year 2022 was the first year I got into the STEAM center the atmosphere was great. I met my new classmates, my new teachers, the new facility and met my newfound passion of coding. There are 2 different things when starting up Full Stack Development learning to code and doing the code. 

My first time learning to code was very unique and confusing because I didn't know what I was learning but at the same time I was interested in this class. When I was doing the code it made me more entertained because I was hands on, and I was trying different coding languages.
