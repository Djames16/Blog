### What is Flask?
Flask is a framework written in Python, as it's known for its simple and ease of use in building web applications and APIs. Flask helps create diverse web pages by providing tools and libraries for routing, template rendering, and handling HTTP requests. Flask is written in Python, while HTML/CSS are markup and styling languages.Flask allows developers to interact with the routing, and databases, while HTML/CSS, on the other hand, are used for structuring web pages. Flask provides the backend development for web applications, while HTML/CSS are used for defining the frontend side. 

Some languages that Flask uses would be: 
1. Python
2. Jinja 
3. JavaScript
4. HTML
5. CSS
6. SQL 
7. JSON 
8. Markdown
9. OAuth 
10. Pytest

### Learning about Flask

The resources that I found helpful and would recommend when learning about Flask would be Flask Documentation, Stack Overflow, and Youtube Tutorials.

1. **Official Flask Documentation**: The Flask documentation is easy to understand, covering everything from basic usage to advanced topics. It serves as an reference while learning Flask and developing applications.

2. **Stack Overflow**: Stack Overflow is a platform for asking and answering programming-related questions.

3. **YouTube Tutorials**: There are numerous video tutorials available on YouTube that cover Flask development. These videos often provide visual demonstrations of concepts.

### Challenges in Flask

Understanding how requests are handled by Flask routes and how responses are generated which can be solved by reading the Flask documentation and following tutorials. Setting up database connections is another challenge which can be solved by going step by step reviewing tutorials or documentation. It may be challenging to understand the various authentication methods and how to securely manage users which can be solved by reviewing Flask extensions like Flask-Login or Flask-Security, along with tutorials and documentation focused on authentication. Lastly understanding how to set up tests in your code which can be solved by following tutorials on Flask testing and writing tests for different parts of the application. All of these challenegs really can all be solved with practice and studying and understanding how Flask works.

### Swipes
My Social Media Flask project called Swipes is a web application built using the Flask framework in Python. It provides users with a platform to connect, share content, and interact with others in a social networking environment. Implementing features like liking, commenting, and sharing posts. Learning about securely storing users information, implementing authentication and authorization within a database. Designing a user-friendly ethusiastic interface.Lastly Dealing with user content, and making a positive Swipes community.

So far in my website I have incorporated these 4 things:

1. **User Authentication**: Users can sign up for an account, log in, and log out securely.
2. **Profile Management**: Users can edit their profile information, upload profile pictures, and view other users' profiles.
3. **Post Creation and Interaction**: Users can create new posts, including text, images, or links, and interact with posts by liking, commenting, and sharing.
4. **Feed Page**: Users have a feed displaying posts from users they follow.
