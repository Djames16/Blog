![Alt text](Wall-E.jpeg)
In the film WALL-E, AI is described through two main personalities: WALL-E and AUTO.

AI is shown to be coexisting robots to humans helping them with simple or major tasks.They are depicted to have a job or role of assisting humans and specifcally AUTO and WALL-E break those roles. They interact with humans by providing them with assistance in tasks. There function is to help the humans getback to planet earth.

As a result of AI taking over these small tasks, humans forgot how to do many things and that led to the earth turning into a economic crisis state. As Humans become more and more reliant on AI, there will be a handul of tasks that we will not remember how to do especially simple tasks leading to many problems within our civilization leading to things going wrong.

The film shows what humans and AI to coexist as long as long as we don't become over reliant on it and losing our touch with humanity, AI can be a huge step to creating a better civilization. This suggests that in the future humans will depend alot on AI leading to many losses in humanity, and the only way to prevent that is to not use the AI but coexist with it.

The benefits of heavy reliance would be the easiness of how life would be pertaining to what you have to do to live and survive when everything is given to you but the drawbacks is losing alot of things that need human interaction, losing intelligence and losing the right to do things on our own. This compares as Humans use AI for almost everything because it is a quick way to get information, but with that quick information we lose our ability to research and makes us lazy.
